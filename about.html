          <h1>Beck Andersen</h1>

          <div class="about-page__statement">
            <p>At the core of my work is a fascination with the networks of dependence and trust, whether academic, technological, or infrastructural, which silently dictate how we see and measure the world. My images stage encounters between the organic and the constructed: forests bisected by infrastructure, light caught within industrial grids, surfaces marked by both erosion and growth. These function not as signs of prosperity or catastrophe, but as records of reciprocal shaping, where human intentions and natural processes press against each other with competing ends.</p>

            <p>Appropriating the language and tools of AI, mapping, and surveillance, I work to expose their assumed neutrality, cultivating a more provisional mode of seeing that accepts multiplicity, fragility, and negotiation as constants rather than problems to be solved. This leads me to approach photography as data: built to be transmuted, manipulated, and directed toward ends determined by intention. My images rarely remain flat prints on the wall. Instead, they flow into and within the space, directly shaping how viewers move with and through the work.</p>

            <p>My current project, As Light Turns Into Day, examines light as humanity's first unit of measurement, an initial tool by which we began to order time and space. By embracing this assumed authority, I transform the processes of printing, collaging, and re-photographing into acts of truth-making rather than truth-finding. Through techniques like the two-layer CMY/K process separation used in my lightboxes, I foreground the manipulation inherent to every image: shaping a narrative while making its artifice visible. The images shift from source material to artifacts in their own right.</p>

            <p>I find the afterlife of an image more significant than its taking. The processes that follow are where I work: in the space where documentation and construction blur, where what we see and what we agree to believe press against one another. The networks we depend on to measure, navigate, and verify present themselves as neutral, as though they precede us rather than emerge from us. I am drawn to images that make these dependencies visible without pretending to stand outside of them. Photography has always participated in the systems it claims to document; my work asks what it might mean to acknowledge this openly, treating the image not as evidence but as proposal: contingent, constructed, and still under negotiation.</p>
